Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the **k** closest points to the origin **(0, 0)**.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e.,  
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2&plus;(y_1-y_2)^2})

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed to be unique** (except for the order that it is in).

### Example 1:

<img src="../Imagens/exemplo_1.png" alt="Q1" width="600"/>


```

Input: points = \[\[1,3],\[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: \[\[-2,2]]

```

**Explanation:**  
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).  
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).  
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.  
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].


### Example 2:

```

Input: points = \[\[3,3],\[5,-1],\[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: \[\[3,3],\[-2,4]]

```

**Explanation:**  
The answer [-2,4], [3,3] would also be accepted.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= points.length <= 10‚Å¥`  
- `-10‚Å¥ <= xi, yi <= 10‚Å¥`
